This example script connects to an FX3 board, blinks the user-addressable LED, and continuously reads accelerometer output registers from an ADIS1650x IMU. The FX3 board is configured to trigger a read when a data ready signal is received. The data read from the IMU is passed to MATLAB where it is then FFT'd and plotted. 

Reference documentation for .NET <-> Matlab data conversions can be found on Mathwork's website [link](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_external/passing-net-data-in-matlab.html).

**NOTE:** This example uses relative paths to locate resources based on the FX3 API repository structure. To use this example as a stand-alone application outside of this repository, the paths to the necessary .dll files (contained within the `resources` folder in the root of this repository) should be updated to reflect the new folder structure.
